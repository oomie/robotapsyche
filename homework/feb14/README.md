## Final Idea: 
I ended up simulating a sort of allergic reaction, or atleast a representation of it. Basically, when the 'germ' or whatever youre allergic to, gets close to
the organism (which you control with your mouse) the allergy gets worse - this is shown by the allergy increasing in size when it comes into close contact with
the germ. 

### Process:
At first, I actually wanted to simulate fishes in a tank , with the attractor being fish food. I tried to make the attractor decrease in size when the fish 'ate' it,
or collided with it, but somehow the attractor ended uo growing bigger. I also tried adding multiple fish to this code (an array of movers, essentially),  but 
i kept getting a NullPointerException. Then I realized that the behavior was similar to an allergy, so I decided to keep it as it was and just change the color of
the two ellipses. 

Here are some images from the program:
