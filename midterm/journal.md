# Midterm Project Progress 

## Project Proposal: 

Option 1:  A simulator

You are tasked with looking after a group of children, you have to please them by giving them rewards like stickers and chocolates when they stay out of trouble, and their admiration towards you levels up. If they get out of control, you have to get their attention and keep them out of trouble. Maybe each child can react differently, have different personalities etc.

Option 2: Birds

You're at the park birdwatching and feeding a group of the birds, observing how they fly and how they are attracted to you when you give them food. Some of them may come, eat a little of the food you dropped for them, then fly off before coming back for more. Some of the other birds may exhibit different behaviors, watch and see!
