# Midterm Project: Babysitting Simulator!

## Instructions:
### Your little sister Mei has invited her friend over to play with her in your home's backyard, but it is your job to babysit them and make sure they don't cause any chaos! (give them candy to make them listen to you!)

Use the mouse to give them candy, and at some point their adoration levels toward you will max out and they will stop causing mischief!
